Hi, this is Steven Xia! I am a first year CS PhD student at the University of Chicago,
advised by Prof. [Raul Castro Fernandez](https://raulcastrofernandez.com/). Before coming to
UChicago, I got my Bachelors of Computer Science from the University of Waterloo, 
where I closely worked with Prof. [Semih Salihoglu](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~ssalihog/) and 
Prof. [Xi He](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~xihe/).
